NeMo Vision Collection
========================

The NeMo Vision Collection is designed to support the multimodal collection, particularly for models like LLAVA that necessitate a vision encoder implementation. At present, the vision collection features support for ViT, a customized version of the transformer model from Megatron core.

Our [documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/index.html) offers comprehensive insights into each supported model, facilitating seamless integration and utilization within your projects.
