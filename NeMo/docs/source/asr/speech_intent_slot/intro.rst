Speech Intent Classification and Slot Filling
==============================================

**Intent Classification and Slot Filling** aims to not only recognize the user's intention, but also detect entity slots and their corresponding lexical fillers. Below is an example:


.. image:: images/example.png
        :align: center
        :scale: 50%
        :alt: slurp_example


Different from its counterpart in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) that takes text as input, here the model predicts the semantics directly from audio input.
