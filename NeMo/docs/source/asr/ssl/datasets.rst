Datasets
========

Any dataset available in NeMo for ASR (`ASR datasets <../datasets.html>`__) can be used for SSL. 
To create your own NeMo compatible datasets, refer to 
`Preparing Custom ASR Data <../datasets.html#preparing-custom-asr-data>`__  
section. Note that explicit labels (transcriptions) are not utilized in SSL and hence are optional 
when creating datasets for SSL.
