# It contains the default values for training a Conformer-MMI (CTC) ASR model, large size (~120M) with CTC loss and sub-word encoding.

# Architecture and training config:
# Default learning parameters in this config are set for effective batch size of 2K. To train it with smaller effective
# batch sizes, you may need to re-tune the learning parameters or use higher accumulate_grad_batches.
# Here are the recommended configs for different variants of Conformer-CTC, other parameters are the same as in this config file.
# One extra layer (compared to original paper) is added to the medium and large variants to compensate for replacing the LSTM decoder with a linear one.

# If you do not want to train with AMP, you may use weight decay of 0.0 or reduce the number of time maskings to 2
# with time_width=100. It may help when you want to train for fewer epochs and need faster convergence.
# With weight_decay=0.0, learning rate may need to get reduced to 2.0.
