name: Isort and Black Formatting
# Incrementally reformat only changed files with black, all files with isort
#
# Replaces pre-commit.ci, since it reformats all the files.
# See issue https://github.com/pre-commit-ci/issues/issues/90
#
# The action requires a custom token to trigger workflow after pushing reformatted files back to the branch.
# `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` can be used instead, but this will result
# in not running necessary checks after reformatting, which is undesirable.
# For details see https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25702
