For example, if there are four speakers `(A, B, C, D)`, we extract 6 pairs: `(A,B)`, `(A,C)`, `(A,D)`, `(B,C)`, `(B,D)`, `(C,D)`. Finally, the sigmoid outputs are averaged. In this way, MSDD can deal with a flexible number of speakers using a pairwise model.\n",

    "As in the training process, we can also break down the target samples for inference. While we can do inference on whole input audio at once, split inference generally gives an improved performance. It is recommended to use the same step-count you used for training the MSDD model (e.g., `diar_window_length=50`) for your inference configurations."
