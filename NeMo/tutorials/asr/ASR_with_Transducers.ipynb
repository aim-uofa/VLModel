        "1) **Any CTC config can be easily converted to a Transducer config** by copy-pasting the default Transducer config components.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Dataset processing for CTC and Transducer models are the same!** If it works for CTC it works exactly the same way for Transducers. This also applies to Character-based models vs. Sub-word tokenization-based models.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Fused Batch during training and evaluation significantly reduces the need for large GPU memory**, and we can simply reduce the `fused_batch_size` to process samples at a larger acoustic (global) batch size (the maximum batch size that can be passed through the acoustic model, disregarding the Prediction and Joint models).\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Once trained, **transducer models implicitly can be used for beam search**! The prediction network acts as an implicit language model and can easily be used for this beam search by switching the decoding configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "5) **Alignments can be easily extracted from Transducers** by adding a special flag to the Decoding setup. After this, it is quite simple to extract the 2-d alignment grid of the transducer for samples or a batch of samples. It must be noted that this alignment information does require slightly more memory, and increases decoding time by a small amount as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
