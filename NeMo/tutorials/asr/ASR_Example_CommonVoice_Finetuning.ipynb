    "\n",
    "Mozilla Common Voice provides 1400 hours of validated Esperanto speech (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.0667)). However, the final training dataset consists only of 250 hours because the train, test, and development sets are bucketed such that any given speaker may appear in only one. This ensures that contributors seen at train time are not seen at test time, which would skew results. Additionally, repetitions of text sentences are removed from the train, test, and development sets of the corpus”. \n",

In general, we observed, that  global batch between 512 and 2048 works well for Conformer-CTC-Large model. One can  use   the [accumulate_grad_batches](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/examples/asr/conf/conformer/conformer_ctc_bpe.yaml#L173) parameter to increase the size of the global batch, which is equal  to *local_batch * num_gpu * accumulate_grad_batches*.\n",

The number of warmup steps determines how quickly the scheduler will reach the peak learning rate during model training. The recommended number of steps is approximately 10-20% of total training duration. We used 8,000-10,000 warmup steps.\n",

    "At the end of the training, several checkpoints (usually 5) and the best model (not always from the latest epoch) are stored in the model folder. Checkpoint averaging (script) can help to improve the final decoding accuracy. In our case, this did not improve the CTC models. However, it was possible to get an improvement in the range of 0.1-0.2% WER for some RNNT models. To make averaging, use the following command:\n",

Removing them from the training set is preferred because a model can train text even for almost empty audio. We do not want this behavior from the ASR model."
