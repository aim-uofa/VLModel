    "# Confidence-based Ensembles of End-to-End ASR Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we discuss how to use confidence-based ensembles to improve different aspects of ASR models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are only going to cover basics in this tutorial, so make sure to check out our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15824) to learn more details!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we are going to learn **what** a confidence-based ensemble is, let's discuss **why** you might want to use one. A high-level motivation behind this method is that there are many \"expert\" ASR models that are publicly available. These models are often specialized to a certain language, accent or domain and might not perform well outside of it. But what if you need to cover multiple such target domains and you don't have a single model that works well on all of them? This is exactly the case when you should try confidence-based ensembles! In our paper we show two applications of this general idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you need to support multi-lingual ASR, but don't have a single model that covers all your languages, you basically have two choices. You can either run a separate [language-identification](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/langid_ambernet) (LID) block first to pick an ASR model from the corresponding language. Or you can run all models in parallel and use confidence to select which output to use. In the paper we show that the second method generally works better and can be even combined with LID model for the best results.\n",
    "2. If you have a generic ASR model as well as a [finetuned version](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/tutorials/asr/ASR_CTC_Language_Finetuning.ipynb) that works much better on a target domain. In such a case, your finetuned model will likely degrade on the \"base\" domain. What if you need to support both cases in a single application and don't have an easy way to know which domain the input comes from? To solve this, you can use confidence ensembles to pick the right output automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also briefly talk about some limitations of the confidence-based ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Confidence-based ensembles are not well suited for latency-critical applications as they require a few seconds of audio to select the most confident model.\n",
    "2. The runtime cost grows linearly with each added model, which limits the practically useful ensemble size.\n",
    "3. Given enough compute and data, it is likely possible to build specialized models that would outperform confidence-based ensembles on most tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up — if you're combining a small number of models (e.g., up to 5), can afford a few seconds of additional latency and don't have resources to build a specialized model, confidence-based ensembles might be a good fit and you should try them out! There are many ASR models that you can combine in the ensemble available in [NVIDIA NGC cloud](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models) as well as other model hubs, such as [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/nvidia).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few cells we will cover what a confidence-based ensemble is and some best practices of using these models. Each cell is mostly self-contained, so feel free to skip around or jump directly to the code part if you want to see usage examples right away."

    "## What is a confidence-based ensemble?\n",
    "\n",
    "You're probably familiar with more traditional [ensembles of machine learning models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning). Confidence ensembles are a less popular approach where we only use an output of a single model that is deemed best for the current input. A typical way to pick the \"best\" output is to select a model with the highest confidence score, which provides an estimate of how likely the output is to be correct. Here is a schematic illustration of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/releases/download/v1.19.0/conf-ensembles-overview.png\" alt=\"Confidence-ensemble schematic representation\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, to define confidence ensemble, we need to define 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which models are part of the ensemble.\n",
    "2. How do we estimate model's confidence.\n",
    "3. How do we \"calibrate\" confidence values via a model selection block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss each of these 3 items below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which models to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "A short answer — you can use any ASR models. E.g., you can combine a number of CTC models, or Transducer models, or even mix-and-match. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed answer is that the performance of the confidence ensemble is upper-bounded by the performance of the best model on each of the input examples. Thus you will benefit if some of your models work really well on part of the input compared to other models. This way you will get more gains compared to each separate model, and it will also make correct model identification easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to estimate a model's confidence?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good news, we have a whole separate [tutorial](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/tutorials/asr/ASR_Confidence_Estimation.ipynb) on this topic! You can go through it if you want to know all the details about different ways to estimate confidence of NeMo ASR models. There are different confidence measures and aggregation functions and for the absolute best performance, you will need to run a grid-search to pick the best confidence estimation way for your specific models and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, we found that there exist a set of confidence parameters that work pretty well on a large set of models and datasets. They are default in NeMo and so you might not need to worry about running the search. If you do want to maximize the performance by tuning the confidence parameters, you only need to add [a few extra config lines](#Building-and-evaluating-ensemble-(tuned-parameters)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to calibrate confidence values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now talk about the \"model selection block\". First of all — you don't need to know the details to use confidence ensembles, calibration is always automatically performed when you build the model. But if you want to learn more, read on!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's discuss why we need a separate \"model selection block\" to pick the most confident model. If we had an access to the perfect confidence, which would exactly equal to the probability of the model's output being correct, we wouldn't need this block. In this idealized case we can simply take the model with the maximum confidence score. But in practice, models tend to be over- or under-confident, which means that their confidence scores need to be calibrated together to be comparable. E.g., one model might mostly produce scores from 0 to 0.8, while another model tend to produce scores from 0 to 0.5, even though they have the same average accuracy. So we want to multiply the first model's score by 1.25 and the second model's score by 2.0 to put the on the same \"scale\".\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the goal of the model selection block is to pick the right model for each input. So it needs to solve a standard classification task, where the set of all model's confidence scores is the input and the \"most confident\" model index is the output. Since this is a standard classification problem in a low-dimensional space, we found that using a logistic regression (LR) model is sufficient to solve it with a high accuracy. We assume that for each model there exist a small (e.g., 100-1000 examples) set of input utterances that the model performs the best on. E.g., if you build a multi-lingual ensemble, this set will come from the language the model is trained to recognize. We will use these samples → model correspondence as the ground-truth for training LR.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_note:_**  If you don't have a clear \"audio → best recognition model\" correspondence, you can still build it artificially, as long as you also have ground-truth text labels. Just take a larger set of inputs, run all models on them and compute WER. This will tell you which model works best for which audio. But note that if all your models perform very similarly, the gains from confidence ensembling will also be minimal!\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though logistic regression is a simple model and operates in a low-dimensional space, we found that it's still beneficial sometimes to tune its hyperparameters, especially if your input data is imbalanced (e.g., you have more ground-truth samples for some models than others). This tuning is very cheap and so will be performed automatically, as long as you [specify a validation set in the config](#Building-and-evaluating-ensemble-(tuned-parameters))."
