                "Intent recognition is the task of classifying the intent of an utterance or document. For example,  for the query:  `What is the weather in Santa Clara tomorrow morning?`, we would like to classify the intent as `weather`. This is a fundamental step that is executed in any task-driven conversational assistant.\n",

                "Typical text classification models, such as the Joint Intent and Slot Classification Model in NeMo, are trained on hundreds or thousands of labeled documents. In this tutorial we demonstrate a different, \"zero shot\" approach that requires no annotated data for the target intents. The zero shot approach uses a model trained on the task of natural language inference (NLI). During training, the model is presented with pairs of sentences consisting of a \"premise\" and a \"hypothesis\", and must classify the relationship between them as entailment (meaning the hypothesis follows logically from the premise), contradiction, or neutral. To use this model for intent prediction, we define a list of candidate labels to represent each of the possible classes in our classification system; for example, the candidate labels might be `request for directions`,  `query about weather`, `request to play music`, etc. We predict the intent of a query by pairing it with each of the candidate labels as a premise-hypothesis pair and using the model to predict the probability of an entailment relationship between them. For example, for the query and candidate labels above, we would run inference for the following pairs:\n",
                "\n",
                "(`What is the weather in Santa Clara tomorrow morning?`, `request for directions`)  \n",
                "(`What is the weather in Santa Clara tomorrow morning?`, `request to play music`)   \n",
                "(`What is the weather in Santa Clara tomorrow morning?`, `query about weather`)\n",
                "\n",
                "In the above example, we would expect a high probability of entailment for the last pair, and low probabilities for the first two pairs. Thus, we would classify the intent of the utterance as `query about weather`. The task can be formulated as single-label classification (only one of the candidate labels can be correct for each query) or multi-label classification (multiple labels can be correct) by setting the parameter multi_label = False or multi_label = True, respectively, during inference.\n",
