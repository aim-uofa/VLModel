    "### FastPitch\n",
    "\n",
    "FastPitch is non-autoregressive model for mel-spectrogram generation based on FastSpeech, conditioned on fundamental frequency contours. For more details about model, please refer to the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06873). NeMo re-implementation of FastPitch additionally uses unsupervised speech-text [aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10447) which was originally implemented in [FastPitch 1.1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/SpeechSynthesis/FastPitch).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixer-TTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixer-TTS is another non-autoregressive model for mel-spectrogram generation. It is structurally similar to FastPitch: duration prediction, pitch prediction, unsupervised TTS alignment framework, but the main difference is that Mixer-TTS is based on the [MLP-Mixer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601) architecture adapted for speech synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastPitch and Mixer-TTS like most NeMo models are defined as a LightningModule, allowing for easy training via PyTorch Lightning, and parameterized by a configuration, currently defined via a yaml file and loading using Hydra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look using NeMo's pretrained models and how to use it to generate spectrograms."
