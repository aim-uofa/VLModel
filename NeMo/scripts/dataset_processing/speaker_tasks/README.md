# Speaker Tasks Dataset Scripts

In this folder are scripts to download speaker tasks (mainly for diarization) datasets. These scripts will return NeMo format manifest files to use with Diarization.

We also have scripts for CallHome and DIHARD3, however the data has to be downloaded separately. If you require the scripts please leave an issue.
